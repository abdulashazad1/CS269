# Game Design - bruce maxwell (january 2022)
I made this game for my JanPlan class at Colby in my freshman year. I was one of three programmers on the game. We also had a graphic designer, a producer, and an audio designer. Run main.py to traverse
the dungeon we created, facing a variety of enemies and powering up until you meet the boss.
