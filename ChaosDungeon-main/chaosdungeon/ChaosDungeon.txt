-Q: PLEASE TELL ME, WHY ARE YOU IN THIS DUNGEON?????
1. I come here to seek refuge. The outside world is far more dangerous.
2. I’m here for love.                                                                                               3. I’m here to serve as a loyal slave for the dungeon master.                                 4. I’m just lost.                                                                                                         Your choice is: (press space and then answer)

-after clearing the first room, a figure suddenly appears behind the hero--
-??: BOO.
-Hero: What the…!
-??: HEY! HAVE YOU PICKED WHO YOU ARE?
-Hero: …yes?
-??: AND HOW DO YOU LIKE MY DUNGEON? ARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT I’VE BEEN PREPARING FOR YOU? DO YOU FEEL AT HOME?
-Hero:
1. Fight
2. Leave                                                                                                                  3. Hello…? You’re…?                                                                                             Your choice is: (press space and then answer)

-DM: I AM THE DUNGEON MASTER.
-Hero:
1. You don’t need to talk in all caps. You’re not being intimidating.
2. Nice to meet you Dungeon Master. How should I address you?                       3. I’m scared.                                                                                                           4. PREPARE TO DIE!                                                                                              Your choice is: (press space and then answer)

-DM: OMNIPOTENCE IS MY NAME.
-Hero:
1. Oh, nice to meet you, Dungeon Omnipotence Master.
2. Are you really omnipotent?                                                                                3. Should I be scared?                                                                                           4. PREPARE TO DIE!                                                                                          Your choice is: (press space and then answer)

-DM: Okay, alright, you couldn't remember who I am, and now you’re questioning my omnipotence, all good signs. I guess I’ve messed with your cognitive system a bit too much when transporting you here. I’m sorry. But never mind. Did you enjoy the killing?
-Hero:
1. Why do I know so well how to swing a sword, and am so willing to slash at others with it, even if it’s only for my own survival?
2. Cleansing those nasty goblins was no challenge. Wait until I try out the big bosses.
3. No, I enjoy dating hot NPCs. Do you have any of those in store?
4. NOW I’M GONNA ENJOY IT MORE.                                                                     Your choice is: (press space and then answer)

-DM:... 
-Maybe don't try too hard rationalizing my question? I only want to know if you enjoyed it. It’s an impulsive thing. Is the voice in your head telling you to kill more?
-Hero:
1. Yes.
2. No.                                                                                                                         3. First of all, it’s not an impulse; it’s my decision. Just like how I decided my reason for being here.                                                                                       Your choice is: (press space and then answer)

-DM:
(1) Good. Go kill or be killed then. Spend your life whatever you want, not that it’s gonna matter in my dungeon anyway.
(2) Good. Try your best to hide and survive then. Spend your life whatever you want, not that it’s gonna matter in my dungeon anyway.
(3) No no, only mine are decisions. It’s always impulses for you lot. Now spend your life whatever you want, not that it’s gonna matter in my dungeon anyway.
Hero: Wait, what do you mean “it’s not gonna matter in your dungeon”?
-DM: …
Hero: Hello??
DM: See these doors? Each of them leads to another box-shaped room, which will have more doors leading to more box-shaped rooms. Even if you manage to break the floor or the ceiling, you end up in some other rooms. Box-shaped rooms will be all you see. 
Hero: But… isn’t there an end? Somewhere? Sometime?
DM: There will be destinations, once in a while. You’re welcomed to take those final doors, and feel accomplished. Then you will always return to here: the beginning. As proud as I am of my dungeon, I didn’t come up with a spatial plan for it, so the only way you can go is to run from one room into a different one, again and again. What do you think?
Hero:
1. Get me out of here immediately!
2. Fine. Make it worse then. Take me deeper.
3. I’m glad you asked. I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU. (fight)
DM: (1, 2) I won’t. This is just how it is. 
Hero: …
DM: …
Hero: …
DM: Unless… Hey. (suddenly pokes at the hero)
Hero: Unless what?
DM: Unless you kill me.
Hero: How’s that possible? Aren’t you omnipotent?
DM: One good thing about being omnipotent is that being killed no longer matters to me. Perhaps it still matters to you, though.
Hero:
1. But I don’t wanna kill you.
2. Why? How’s that gonna change anything? 
3. You’re insane.
4. I CAN?! (fight)
DM: (1, 2, 3) I don’t think you would understand, but I really, really want you to kill me. That might change something. We will see. As for now, I’ll leave you be. Do stay alive and thrive for me, alright?
Hero:
1. Wait, I have too many questions…
2. Don’t leave me alone…
3. See ya later.
4. I don’t wanna see you ever again.
5. LET’S END THIS RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW.
