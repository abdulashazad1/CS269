DM: It’s me again!


-
-
You: I finally get to see you again. What do you want?



-
-
DM: Do you wanna know the only way out of here? You’re gonna kill me first.


-
-
You: What? Why? And why didn’t you tell me the first time we’ve met? I could’ve at least tried back then!



-
-
DM: I wanted to, but the scheming little look you were having on your face… I got scared, and changed my mind for a while… but now I’m ready for the experience.

1. I wasn’t scheming anything!
2. So you're not as omnipotent as I thought.
3. No you're not ready. Neither do I. I need more time to master my skills.
4. Do engrave that fear in your mind, if you have one.

You: Still, why?

DM: To put it simply, I deserve it.

1. I can still back off, right?
2. I thought we were bros. Why must we kill each other?
3. I’m not gonna let your wish come true.
4. Let me show you an OMNIPOTENT killer then.
