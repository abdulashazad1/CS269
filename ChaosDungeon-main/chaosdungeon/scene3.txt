Fairy: Hello.

1. Hi.
2. F*** off.
3. Please tell me you're not Dungeon Master in disguise.
4. Whoever you are, you’d better bring me some good news.

Fairy: I didn’t mean to confuse you. I just have something to show you. Here. You can take one of these as a gift from me, for helping me gather food. Take this as a token of my gratitude. 


-
-
You: You mean those monsters I’ve just slain? I don’t see them as food… for now. More like I’m food in their eyes.


-
-
Fairy: What an interesting perspective on your prey! Well, to further erase your worries of starving to death or having to devour your prey for survival someday, I offer you my blessings. They will infuse you with more than enough energy you need for fights and flights. By the way, they’re toxic-free, organic, and delicious. 


-
-
You: But how are you so sure your blessings will work on me? We’re like two totally different… species.



-
-
Fairy: Oh, I’m so sorry about that! I had been making them for a friend, who looked very similar to you, so I might’ve just assumed…


-
-
You: If you don't mind, I still need to know what they are exactly made of, before I ever try one.


-
-
Fairy: Let’s just say, I’m better at managing resources than most creatures here.


-
-
You: That’s not exact enough.


-
-
Fairy: … Well, I mean, I’m just very efficient at digesting essential nutrients and storing the excess energy I expelled for other uses… See, that’s also why I don’t want you to eat those monsters. They’ll be bad for your stomach!

1. The way you phrase it… sounds weird. 
2. The way you phrase it… sounds strangely enticing. 
3. I don't wanna eat skeletons either.
4. No comment on your recipes.

Fairy: So… deal?


-
*
1. I’d love to… I just need some extra motivation to make the decision. Give me a second.
2. No wonder you have so much wasted energy to spare. 
3. I don’t feel good about killing other creatures for a trade.
4. Why not keep these blessings to yourself for the hard times?

Fairy: Okay, how about a deal with a friend, then? A friend who wants to help you and needs your trust? …Um, sorry if I’m being too aggressive. I’m so obsessed with old memories…

*
1. A mutual relationship you mean. Fine by me.
2. Not so fast. I'm not your friend, for now.
3. Why not? It’s good to have company here. 
4. This whole thing still feels like manipulation to me.

Fairy: What else should I do… You know what? To prove that I’m doing this mostly for your sake, I’ll show up every time you’ve cleared a room to give you one of my blessings. How does that sound?


-
*
1. Sure. Are you coming with me?
2. Okay. How will I find you again?
3. Not bad. How will you find me again?
4. We'll see. Are we parting ways soon?

Fairy: I'll leave you with my blessing. Once you’ve imbibed it, I will be able to identify and track your semiochemicals, and then I can just teleport to any identified target! In the meantime, let’s try to keep ourselves safe.

-

1. See you later.
2. Good luck. Don't get killed.
3. Please remember your promise.
4. Do teach me teleportation someday.
