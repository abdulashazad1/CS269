-
You: Hello…? You’re…?




-
-
???: You don’t seem too energetic, or curious. Are my questions scaring you? I thought you like questions.

2.Well, nice to meet you too, creep. 
3.I do have a bunch of questions for you, though. First…
4.I'm more of a "slash first, ask questions later" kind of guy.

DM: Okay, okay. I know you don't like questions. I will not ask you more questions, so don’t be scared ...Well, maybe just one more question. Did you enjoy the killings?

1. I did, but somehow I think I shouldn’t.
2. I enjoy powerups, boss fights and hot NPCs. Do you have any of those in store?
3. I enjoy getting out of here alive, that’s all.
4. I’ll enjoy it more when I get you.

DM: Uh, okay, that’s not what I wanted to hear. I guess I’ll just leave you here longer then, until you become an OMNIPOTENT killer. Fortunately I’ve created enough rooms for you, so you shouldn’t be able to go anywhere.

You: Can't you just listen to what I'm saying for a minute?!

DM: ...scary...

1. Okay, I get it that you’re super insane and probably powerful and have kept me as your personal pet.
2. You know what I think about all this bull***t?...
3. You rule here, boss. Just one small thing...
4. This isn’t real…

1. ...I only need you to tell me there’s an end to all this.
2. ...I don’t even think any of these matters to you. F*** everything in this dungeon.
3. ...Anything else you want me to do besides massacring every living being?
4. ...Mommy and daddy, where are you...
